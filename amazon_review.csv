B0CHXCXKPD,Sunny dhama,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat battery life and seamless integration!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2023","I recently acquired the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) with the Starlight Aluminum Case and Starlight Sport Band, and I must say it has been a game-changer for me. As a graduate student pursuing a master's in computer science at the University of Florida and a research assistant at the Learn Dialogue Lab, I needed a smartwatch that could seamlessly integrate into my active lifestyle, help me stay on top of my health, and even assist in my research tasks. The Apple Watch SE has exceeded my expectations in all these aspects.One of the standout features for me is the fitness and sleep tracking capabilities. With my busy schedule, it's crucial to keep tabs on my physical activity and sleep patterns. The Apple Watch SE does an excellent job of tracking my steps, calories burned, and even encourages me to move when I've been sitting for too long. The sleep tracking feature has been a revelation, providing insights into the quality of my sleep and helping me make adjustments for better rest.Being a tech enthusiast and someone deeply involved in the IT sector, I appreciate the crash detection and heart rate monitoring functions. Safety is paramount, and the watch's ability to detect a potential fall and initiate an emergency call is a reassuring feature, especially when I'm out traveling or in the middle of a research project. The heart rate monitor keeps me informed about my cardiovascular health during workouts and daily activities.As someone who loves teaching and mentoring, the Apple Watch SE also helps me manage my busy schedule. The calendar notifications and reminders keep me on track for meetings with my mentees and colleagues at the lab, which is essential for our collaborative projects, such as ""Collaborative sports,"" ""Amby: Language model for middle schoolers,"" and ""Integrate AI.""Moreover, the watch seamlessly integrates with my iPhone, allowing me to respond to messages, emails, and calls without taking out my phone, which is incredibly convenient during our frequent lab meetings and while I'm on the go.In conclusion, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) has become an indispensable part of my daily life. Its fitness and health-tracking features, coupled with its integration into my professional and academic activities, make it a must-have for anyone in the IT sector aiming to be a leader in future IT solutions. Whether I'm teaching React JS or exploring new states in the USA, this smartwatch has proven to be a reliable companion. Highly recommended!"
B0CHXCXKPD,Jerry B,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsElevating Everyday Tech On A Budget,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","When Apple introduced the Watch SE lineup, it was hailed as a budget-friendly alternative to its premium series, catering to users who wanted the core Apple Watch experience without the steep price. With the 2nd Gen Apple Watch SE, the brand has refined an impressive product. I recently gifted this to my daughter as a replacement for her older Apple Watch, and her joy was palpable.The most noticeable improvement is its sleeker design. While it retains the iconic Apple Watch look, there's an undeniable modern refinement to it. This seamless integration of the case and band is more than just aesthetically pleasing and functional. In terms of performance, the updated processor offers quicker responses and smoother command executions. Apps launch with increased speed, and transitions are more fluid, providing a notably enhanced user experience.Software-wise, Apple's updates have made a marked difference. The introduction of new watch faces, expanded health tracking features, and improved notifications show that the company has actively considered user feedback. Another improvement, albeit a minor one, is the battery life. My daughter charges it less frequently than her previous Apple Watch, which is always a bonus.Pairing the watch with her iPhone was straightforward, and its compatibility with all her apps stands out, emphasizing the smooth interoperability Apple is known for. In terms of value for money, the Watch SE (2nd Gen) hits the mark given its features and the improvements over its predecessor.In conclusion, whether you're contemplating an upgrade from an older model or considering it as a gift for a loved one, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is a stellar choice. It exemplifies Apple's dedication to quality, innovation, and user satisfaction. My daughter's sheer delight with her new watch speaks volumes about its capabilities and charm. I highly recommend it!"

The Apple Watch SE is now (Oct. 2023) shipping with Watch OS 10, which in turn requires iOS 17. iOS 17 ONLY works with iPhone XR/XS and later.Don't order if you have an iPhone X or earlier model!

It does not pick up naps or short intervals of sleep. A lump has also formed on my wrist where the watch sits.  The lump formed 3 days after the return date expired so I am stuck with a watch I can no longer use. It has to be recharged every day. I cannot remove some items from the main menu so it takes an extra moment to scroll thru all the offerings.

Also if you have friends or partners with an Apple Watch the walkie talkie feature is awesome. Now the bad. Even with minimal features battery life is 24 hours at best. You‚Äôll charge daily. Even if you charge this before bed and try to use it as a sleep tracker it is hit and miss. If you want a fitness and sleep tracker the other brand is the way to go. If you‚Äôre deep in apple and want a smartwatch that works with everything apple. This is the way to go.

B0CHXCXKPD,DPearl,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0 out of 5 starsMixed feelings,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","If you had asked me right after I started using this watch to rate this watch, I'd give it a 5 star hands down.  I made the old switch-aroo from a Galaxy to an iphone, and from a Galaxy watch to an Apple watch.  The positives - more stylish, sleek.  Pretty easy to use, and the amount of data it had, both on the watch and in your app on the phone, continues to amaze me.  Like, my average walking speed; or the average length of each step.  Talk about a ton of data!However, due to questionable data, I feel cheated, and now our marriage is starting to dissolve.  I first noticed my sleep data didn't seem consistent compared to my Halo Rise and Google Nest 2nd gen Hub. And now after three months of using the watch I don't even rely on it for looking at my sleep.  Not when it has me in REM sleep when I was up using the bathroom.  With it now summer I've been riding my bike lately and while it tracks that I'm cycling, like my sleep data, it is nowhere close to accurate.  I went to the beach and back - which is 5 miles each way - and it registered 2.4 miles.  The next time it registered 5.5 miles of the 10 mile roundtrip.  Finally, the battery life is 24 hours at best.A stylish smart watch that is simple to use and rich in features.  An upgrade over the Galaxy watches I've had too.  However, unlike the Galaxy, we have some data inaccuracies that cause me to question how much longer this watch and me will stay together."

The only issue I have is it needs charged every night. Maybe I have setting on that is draining the battery, but for something brand new needing charged every night when it mostly sits on my wrist and tracks my steps seems a bit much to me."

But I gave in and purchased one and im really happy I did. Honestly hands down one of the best purchases I made. You can receive and send texts as well as calls on the Watch. You can control your music on your phone from your watch. The alarm on the watch is my all time favorite thing about the watch it actually wakes me up. The workout and the heart rate detection on the watch is amazing. It‚Äôs perfect for people that workout or have a job that would allow you to wear an Apple Watch to work.

B0CHXCXKPD,Chris,2.0 out of 5 stars,2.0 out of 5 starsGreat Until It Wasn‚Äôt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023","The UI is easily navigable, the speaker in the watch is loud and clear, it perfectly maps exercise, and keeps accurate track of steps, heart rate, and sleep.Unfortunately, the battery, as with all non-laptop Apple products, leaves a lot to be desired. Get a spare charging cable or two to keep in your car and/or bag.Beyond that, my watch failed in under two months. I‚Äôd gone for a swim and noticed the touchscreen wasn‚Äôt functioning properly afterward. There were a couple small cosmetic scratches on the screen and thought that maybe they were just holding water and preventing the touch function from working.A few hours later, it worked again.Went for another swim later that week and the touchscreen failed again.That time, however, I noticed water drops at an edge of the display. When I pressed on the display, more water noticeably came out. In addition to the screen not working, the two buttons were also not functional.Let it dry out and it all started working again.Because the battery was critically low by that time, I put it on the charger and the screen went blank. Couldn‚Äôt turn it on or off and it was no longer connected to my phone.Now, thanks to a manufacturing defect, the only replacement Apple will provide will be a refurbished unit for a product that failed less than 60 days after purchase.And it‚Äôs not an immediate replacement either. According to the Apple Store tech, it‚Äôll be up to 10 days before I get it. Counting 4 already.TLDR: The watch looks great and performs well enough. Unfortunately, the build quality AND service turnaround time aren‚Äôt nearly as good as they used to be.Update: Received a new-looking unit from AppleCare several days after this review went live. Still unimpressed by the lack of QC. Review score remains unchanged."

B0CHXCXKPD,Wasan,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2023","This watch is amazing! It can do so much, With some really cool features such as the mickey or minnie watch face and when you tap them it says the time in there voice! So cute! The only thing pretty much is that its not a usb charger. It come with the charging wire, but you need a specific head for it! Thankfully, Awhile ago i bought an ipad that came with a charging head perfect for the watch charger. If you have a oculus, im pretty sure you could use that head too because my sister has one and the head for it works! All in all, i'd 100% recommend, Just make sure you also purchase the right head with it!"
